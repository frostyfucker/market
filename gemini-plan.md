# Gemini's Plan of Action for "market"

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing the "market" application, from our current state to a fully functional product.

## Phase 1: Project Foundation (Completed)

This initial phase has established the core principles and structure for our project.

- **[x] Project Constitution:** A constitution has been ratified and stored in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, defining our development principles, including Specification and Test-Driven Development.
- **[x] Version Control:** A Git repository has been initialized with a `main` branch for stable releases and a `dev` branch for ongoing development. The repository is connected to GitHub.
- **[x] Workflow Definition:** We have adopted a GitFlow-style branching model where all new work is done in `feature/*` branches.
- **[x] Documentation:** A `CHANGELOG.md` and process templates have been created and configured.
- **[x] High-Level Specification:** The core application goal is defined in `specify.txt`.

## Phase 2: Iterative Feature Development

We will build the application feature by feature, following our constitution. This process will be repeated for each feature. We will start with **User Registration**.

1.  **Create Feature Branch:** For each feature, a new branch will be created from `dev` (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/user-registration`).
2.  **Write Specification (`spec.md`):** A detailed feature specification will be created, outlining user stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria. This is the "Spec-Driven" part of our process.
3.  **Create Implementation Plan (`plan.md`):** A technical plan will be generated, detailing the files to be created/modified and the overall technical approach.
4.  **Generate Task List (`tasks.md`):** The plan will be broken down into a granular, step-by-step task list for implementation.
5.  **Implement with TDD:** Following the "Test-Driven" principle, development will proceed by first writing failing tests, then writing the code to make them pass.
6.  **Submit for Review:** Once a feature is complete and all tests pass, a Pull Request will be opened on GitHub to merge the feature branch into `dev`.
7.  **Merge to `dev`:** After your review and approval, the feature will be merged.

## Phase 3: Backend Development Roadmap (Node.js/Express & PostgreSQL)

The following major backend components will be built iteratively using the process described in Phase 2.

- **User Authentication:**
    - Implement `users` table schema in PostgreSQL.
    - Create secure `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, and `/api/auth/token` endpoints.
    - Integrate `bcrypt` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for session management.
- **Inventory Management:**
    - Implement `items` table schema.
    - Create protected `/api/inventory/upload` endpoint using `multer` for image uploads.
    - Create protected `/api/inventory` endpoint to retrieve a user's items.
- **AI Services Integration:**
    - Create protected `/api/ai/market-research` endpoint to perform market analysis via the `@google/genai` SDK.
    - Create protected `/api/ai/generate-listing` endpoint to generate product titles and descriptions.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development Roadmap (React/TypeScript)

The frontend will be developed in parallel with the backend features.

- **Authentication UI:**
    - Build registration and login forms.
    - Implement client-side logic to handle JWTs, including secure storage of refresh tokens and automatic token renewal.
- **Core UI Components:**
    - Develop a state management solution (e.g., React Context) for user session data.
    - Create an image capture interface using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
    - Build the main inventory dashboard to display cataloged clothing items.

## Phase 5: Future Steps

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing on every pull request and streamline deployment.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the `dev` branch to a staging environment for final review and the `main` branch to a production environment.

---

This plan provides a clear roadmap. The immediate next step is to begin Phase 2 with the "User Registration" feature.
