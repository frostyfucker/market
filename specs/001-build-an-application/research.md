# Research Document for AI-Powered Clothing Catalog

This document addresses the edge cases and ambiguities identified in the feature specification.

## 1. AI Identification Failures
**Question**: What happens if the AI cannot identify the details from the image?

**Decision**: The system will not block the user. The API will return a successful response but with `null` values for the fields it could not identify. The user will be able to manually edit and fill in the missing details on the frontend.

**Rationale**: This provides a graceful failure mode and prevents user frustration. It turns the AI into a powerful assistant, not a gatekeeper.

## 2. Unclear Image Handling
**Question**: What happens if the image is blurry or unclear?

**Decision**: The backend will not perform any specific pre-processing for blurriness. It will send the image to the AI service as-is. The outcome will be handled by the "AI Identification Failures" logic above. The frontend should provide guidance to the user on taking clear photos.

**Rationale**: Adding image pre-processing adds complexity. It's better to rely on the AI's resilience and provide a manual override for the user.

## 3. Missing Market Data
**Question**: What happens if no market data is found for an item?

**Decision**: The `/api/ai/market-research` endpoint will return an empty data set or a specific message indicating that no comparable market data could be found. The frontend will display a user-friendly message like "No market data available for this item."

**Rationale**: This provides a clear and honest response to the user without generating an error.
