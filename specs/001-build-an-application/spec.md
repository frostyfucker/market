## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a clothing reseller, I want to quickly catalog my items by taking pictures, so that the app can automatically extract details and help me research its market value and create a sales listing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I upload a photo of a shirt and its tag, **Then** the system should create a new item in my inventory with the brand, category, size, and material automatically filled out.
2. **Given** I have a cataloged item, **When** I request market research, **Then** the system should provide me with pricing information and market trends for similar items.
3. **Given** I have a cataloged item, **When** I request to generate a listing, **Then** the system should create a compelling title and description for an online marketplace.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the AI cannot identify the details from the image?
- What happens if the image is blurry or unclear?
- What happens if no market data is found for an item?
