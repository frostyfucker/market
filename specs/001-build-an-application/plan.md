# Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Clothing Catalog

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: `spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\market\fresh-build\specs\001-build-an-application\spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the technical implementation for an AI-powered application that allows users to catalog clothing items, research market value, and generate sales listings. The backend will be a Node.js/Express API with a PostgreSQL database, and the frontend will be a React/TypeScript single-page application.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js v20, TypeScript v5, React v18
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, pg (PostgreSQL), bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, multer, React, TailwindCSS, @google/genai
**Storage**: PostgreSQL
**Testing**: Jest (for both backend and frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: API responses < 200ms p95
**Constraints**: Must adhere to the established constitution, including the JWT-based authentication scheme.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial build for a single-user focus, scalable to multiple users.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **Principle VI: Specification and Test-Driven Development**:
    *   [x] **Spec-Driven**: A completed `spec.md` for this feature exists.
    *   [x] **Test-Driven**: This plan includes creating failing tests (contract, integration) before writing implementation code.
*   **Principle I: Defined Technology Stack**:
    *   [x] All technologies in the `Technical Context` section are aligned with the constitution.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Research has been conducted based on the edge cases identified in the specification.
**Output**: `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
The data model, API contracts, and a quickstart guide have been designed based on the functional requirements.
**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
A detailed task list has been generated in `tasks.md` based on the design artifacts. The tasks are ordered to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
**Output**: `tasks.md`

## Complexity Tracking
No violations of the constitution were required.

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (covered by Phase 2)
